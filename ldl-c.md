# 低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）被认为是有害的吗？

|[Home](/README.md)|[Projects](/projects.md)|[Articles](/articles.md)|[Apophthegm](/apophthegm.md)|[About](/about.md)|

低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）主要由两种成分组成：大而轻的 LDL（lbLDL-C，或称为A型）和小而密的 LDL（sdLDL-C，或称为B型）。其中，sdLDL-C 通常被称为“坏”胆固醇。

你可以通过以下公式计算 sdLDL-C 的比例：

```
甘油三酯（TG） / 低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）     
```

解读结果：  
- 低于 1.1 mmol/L 的比率表明胆固醇水平良好。  
- 相反，高于1.1 mmol/L的比率则表明胆固醇水平不佳。

了解这些数值可以帮助你做出明智的胆固醇健康决策。

# Is Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Considered Unfavorable?

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) consists of two main components: large buoyant LDL (lbLDL-C, or Pattern A) and small dense LDL (sdLDL-C, or Pattern B). Among these, sdLDL-C is often referred to as "bad" cholesterol.

You can determine the ratio of sdLDL-C using the following equation:

```
Triglycerides (TG) / Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C)     
```

Interpreting the results:  
- A ratio of less than 1.1 mmol/L indicates a favorable cholesterol profile.  
- Conversely, a ratio greater than 1.1 mmol/L suggests a less favorable cholesterol profile.  

Understanding these values can help you make informed decisions about your cholesterol health.

## REFERENCE

- [Triglyceride/low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol ration is the most valuable predictor for increased small, dense LDL in type 2 diabetes patients (Published 07 January 2022)](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-021-01612-8)

### Summary of the Article

The article discusses the relationship between the triglyceride/low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/LDL-C) ratio and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (sd-LDL) in type 2 diabetes patients. The study found that the TG/LDL-C ratio is a reliable surrogate lipid marker of sd-LDL and is superior to non–high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) in predicting sd-LDL levels in type 2 diabetes patients not treated with statins.

Key Findings

- The TG/LDL-C ratio correlated positively with sd-LDL levels in type 2 diabetes patients.
- The area under the curve (AUC) for the TG/LDL-C ratio was higher than that for non–HDL-C in patients without statins.
- The optimal cut-off point for the TG/LDL-C ratio for increased sd-LDL was 1.1 (molar ratio) regardless of statin treatment.
- The sensitivity and specificity of the TG/LDL-C ratio were higher than those of non–HDL-C in patients without statins.

Conclusion

The study suggests that the TG/LDL-C ratio is a valuable predictor of sd-LDL levels in type 2 diabetes patients and may be used as a surrogate marker for sd-LDL in clinical practice.

### Interpretation of the TG/LDL-C Ratio

The TG/LDL-C ratio is considered a valuable predictor of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (sd-LDL) levels in type 2 diabetes patients. A lower TG/LDL-C ratio is generally considered better.

Optimal Cut-off Point

According to the study, the optimal cut-off point for the TG/LDL-C ratio for increased sd-LDL is 1.1 (molar ratio) regardless of statin treatment. This means that a TG/LDL-C ratio below 1.1 is associated with lower sd-LDL levels, which is desirable.

What a Good TG/LDL-C Ratio Looks Like

A good TG/LDL-C ratio would be:

- Less than 1.1 (molar ratio), indicating lower sd-LDL levels
- Lower values indicating a lower risk of cardiovascular disease

It's essential to note that the TG/LDL-C ratio should be interpreted in conjunction with other lipid profiles and health markers, as well as in the context of individual patient characteristics and medical history.
