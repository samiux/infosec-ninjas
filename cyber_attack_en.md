Malicious hackers often implant attack bots in compromised network devices. These devices can include websites, personal computers, servers, mobile systems, routers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Once compromised, these devices form a botnet that can be used to launch cyberattacks.

As soon as your computer or mobile device connects to the internet, there's a high risk of being targeted by a network attack bot within just 15 minutes, especially if there are exploitable vulnerabilities present. At that point, your device may no longer be under your control.

Typically, these attack bots do not target specific individuals; instead, they carry out indiscriminate attacks, which can also encompass phishing schemes. Most network devices have some level of vulnerabilities, such as zero-day exploits. Once these vulnerabilities are exploited, the invasion is complete.

To enhance security, it is essential to block access to known compromised domain names or IP addresses and to monitor for signs of attacks, such as network scans and malicious payloads. This proactive approach is one of the most effective ways to defend against cyberattacks.

So, how can you implement these protective measures? One of the simplest options is to install an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) or an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An IDPS can intercept cyberattacks in real-time, while an IDS will alert you to potential threats. Generally, IDPS solutions are more user-friendly and do not require specialized knowledge, making them suitable for home users and small to medium-sized businesses. In contrast, IDS may necessitate professional oversight.

Furthermore, you can think of an Intrusion Prevention System as akin to security personnel in a building—constantly monitoring and identifying potential threats, serving as your first line of defense. Meanwhile, antivirus software and firewalls act as your locks and gates, providing your last line of defense. It is also important not to overlook the importance of hardening your browser for additional security.
